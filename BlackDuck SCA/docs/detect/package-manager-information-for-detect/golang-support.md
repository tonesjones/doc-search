# GoLang support

Detector properties

## Overview

Detect has six detectors for GoLang:

- Go Mod CLI (GO_MOD) detector (recommended)
- Go Mod File (GO_MOD) detector
- Go Lock (GO_DEP) detector
- Go Gradle (GO_GRADLE) detector
- Go Vendor (GO_VENDOR) detector
- Go Vndr (GO_VNDR) detector

## Go Mod CLI (GO_MOD) detector

- Discovers dependencies of Go projects that use Go Modules package manager.
- Attempts to run on your project if a go.mod file is found in your source directory.
- Requires the *go* executable to be on the PATH or the executable path to be set with detect.go.path.
- Runs *go list -m*, *go mod why* and *go mod graph*, and parses the output of all to discover direct and transitive dependencies.
- Transitive and unused Go modules may end up as "orphans" if no rightful parent can be found from the information gathered with the above commands. Orphans are automatically assigned as direct dependencies for ease of triaging scan results.

  - You can exclude unused modules (recommended) via the detect.go.mod.dependency.types.excluded=UNUSED property. See below for more details on this property.

### Excluding Test and Build System dependencies

Detect can run additional Go commands to filter out *test* and *build system* dependencies from the BOM.

Use detect.go.mod.dependency.types.excluded=VENDORED to exclude the most dependencies. This will instruct Detect to execute `go mod why -vendor` to generate a list
of modules to exclude.

Use the VENDORED option because running `go mod why` without the `-vendor` flag results in *test* and *build system* dependencies being included in the BOM from Go modules declaring a version prior to `Go 1.16`. See
the [go mod why documentation](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-why) for additional details.

#### Note on current exclusion behavior:

Detect does not exclude any dependencies from the BOM by default.

## Go Mod File (GO_MOD) detector

- Discovers dependencies of Go projects that use Go Modules package manager.
- Attempts to run on your project if a go.mod file is found in your source directory.
- Parses go.mod file to gather dependency information.
- Computes transitive dependency graph by fetching go.mod files of direct dependencies from proxy.golang.org or custom Go proxy supplied via detect.go.forge property. If the proxy is not reachable, the transitive dependencies are listed as additional components under the root module.
- Dependency exclusions (via detect.go.mod.dependency.types.excluded property) are not supported by this detector.

## Go Lock (GO_DEP) detector

- Discovers dependencies of GoLang projects.
- Attempts to run on your project if a Gopkg.lock file is found in your source directory.
- Does not rely on external executables; for example, go, dep, and others.
- Parses Gopkg.lock for dependencies.

## Go Gradle (GO_GRADLE) detector

- Discovers dependencies of go language (GoLang) projects.
- Attempts to run on your project if a gogradle.lock file is found in your source directory.
- Does not rely on external executables; for example, go, dep, and others.
- Parses gogradle.lock for dependencies.

## Go Vendor (GO_VENDOR) detector

- Discovers dependencies of go language (GoLang) projects.
- Attempts to run on your project if the file vendor/vendor.json is found in your source directory.
- Does not rely on external executables; for example, go, dep, and others.
- Parses vendor/vendor.json for dependencies.

## Go Vndr (GO_VNDR) detector

- Discovers dependencies of go language (GoLang) projects.
- Attempts to run on your project if the file vendor.conf is found in your source directory.
- Does not rely on external executables; for example, go, dep, and others.
- Parses vendor.conf for dependencies.
