# Complete list of Bridge arguments

This page lists all the arguments that Bridge CLI supports. Arguments can be passed through environment variables, command line or a JSON file.

Note: We recommend that you pass sensitive information such as access tokens using environment variables.

For a list of arguments that are common to all Black Duck security products, refer to Universal Bridge CLI arguments below.

For product specific arguments, refer to the product specific sections below:

- Polaris
- Black Duck SCA
- Coverity Connect
- Software Risk Manager (SRM)

For integrating Bridge with different SCM platforms, refer to the SCM specific sections below:

- Azure
- Bitbucket
- GitHub
- GitLab

## Universal Bridge CLI arguments

These arguments can be passed on the command line, but not as part of a JSON file.

| Command | Description | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bridge-cli` | Command to invoke Bridge CLI. | Yes |
| `--stage` | The `--stage` command specifies the Black Duck security product you are integrating with (such as `--stage polaris`). | Yes |
| `--input` | The `--input` command loads a JSON file containing common arguments to run scans | Required for inputting a JSON files. |
| `--help` | Shows the help file for Bridge CLI. | No |
| `--json-log` | Outputs JSON format logs. See Logging and Diagnostics. | No |
| `--json-log-file` | Outputs JSON format logs in the `bridge.log` file in the Bridge CLI home directory. See Logging and Diagnostics. | No |
| `--home` | Sets the directory where Bridge CLI writes logs and adapter output (default is .bridge). | No |
| `--version` | Returns the version of Bridge CLI executable. | No |
| `--schema` | Specifies a schema to load | No |
| `--verbose` | Turns on verbose logging. | No |
| `--diagnostics` | Enables debug logs under the Bridge CLI home directory. Creates a `diagnostics.json` file containing the final state data inside the Bridge CLI home directory, but masking sensitive information like tokens and passwords. See Logging and Diagnostics. | No |
| `--out <outFile>` | Creates an output file with the file name and location provided by the user. This file will contain the final state data with masked sensitive information. To include sensitive information in the file, use `--include-sensitive-information` with `--out`. | No |
| `--list <name>` | Show a list of tools and workflows. | No |

## Networking

| Argument | Input mode | | | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Command line argument** | **Environment variable** | **JSON field** |  |  |
| Air Gap mode | `network.airgap` | `BRIDGE_NETWORK_AIRGAP` | network.airgap | No | Default: `false`  This option is not applicable to Coverity, or Polaris users.  For Black Duck® SCA users, Bridge CLI downloads Detect from Black Duck artifactory on the Internet by default. If `network.airgap` is set to `true`, Bridge CLI does not download tools from the public Black Duck artifactory. You must make sure an airgap version of Detect exists locally. Note: Air gap only curtails access to the public Internet. Bridge CLI still needs access to your Black Duck® SCA Hub server even when this option is set to `true`.  Note: SCM API URL is required if you are using the PR comment or Create Fix Pull request features. If not set, Bridge returns an error.  - `github.host.url` for GitHub - `gitlab.api.url` for GitLab - `azure.api.url` for Azure DevOps. |
| Self-Signed Certificate File | `network.ssl.cert.file` | `BRIDGE_NETWORK_SSL_CERT_FILE` | network.ssl.cert.file | No | Accepts a string: you may pass the Certificate file path.   - Available for Coverity Connect only. - If this option is used, then Bridge will trust the self-signed certificate file passed. |
| Trust All Certificates | `network.ssl.trustAll` | `BRIDGE_NETWORK_SSL_TRUSTALL` | network.ssl.trustAll | No | Default: `false`   - Available for Coverity Connect and Black Duck SCA only. - When this option is set to `true`, Bridge will trust all certificates. |

| Use upgraded guidance for Fix PRs | `polaris.fixPR.useUpgradeGuidance` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_FIXPR_UPGRADEGUIDANCE` | `polaris.fixPR.useUpgradeGuidance` | No | Specifies whether to use only short term guidance, only long term guidance, or an ordered preference that allows both for SCA Fix PRs. Bridge tries the guidance values in the order provided. **Values**:  - `SHORT_TERM` - `LONG_TERM` - `SHORT_TERM,LONG_TERM` - `LONG_TERM,SHORT_TERM`  **Default**:`SHORT_TERM,LONG_TERM` |
| Configure when Fix PRs are raised | `polaris.fixPR.filter.severities` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_FIXPR_FILTER_SEVERITIES` | `polaris.fixPR.filter.severities` | No | Bridge creates Fix PRs only for issues with a severity matching a filter. This applies to **both** SAST and SCA if both assessment types are enabled.  **Values**: One or more of the following, separated by commas:  - `CRITICAL` - `HIGH` - `MEDIUM` - `LOW`  **Default**: CRITICAL,HIGH |
| Configure max number of fix PRs that are created on a branch | `polaris.fixPR.maxCount` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_FIX_PR_MAXCOUNT` | `polaris.fixPR.maxCount` | No | Max number of fix PRs created on a branch across both SAST and SCA scans, with SAST evaluated first. Dismissed issues are excluded, then the `polaris.fixPR.filter.severities` allow list is applied. Issues are sorted by severity (descending) and first-detected date (ascending, with undated issues last), and only the first `maxCount` results are selected. **Default**: 5 |
| Polaris parent branch name | `polaris.branch.parent.name` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_BRANCH_PARENT_NAME` | `polaris.branch.parent.name` | No | Parent Branch name in the Polaris server. Applicable only if PR Comments is enabled. For GitHub users only, Bridge reads parent branch name from `github.branch.parent.name`. All other users must specify parent branch name using this option. |
| Severities for which the PR Comments should be created. | `polaris.prcomment.severities` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_PRCOMMENT_SEVERITIES` | `polaris.prcomment.severities` | No | Defaults to `["high", "critical"]`. |
| Enable/disable SARIF report generation | `polaris.reports.sarif.create` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_REPORTS_SARIF_CREATE` | `polaris.reports.sarif.create` | No | Set to "true" to generate a SARIF report.  **Default:** false |
| File path where the SARIF file will be created. | `polaris.reports.sarif.file.path` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_REPORTS_SARIF_FILE_PATH` | `polaris.reports.sarif.file.path` | No | Defines where the SARIF file will be created. (A file name must be included.)  **Default:** <BRIDGE_HOME>/Polaris SARIF Generator/report.sarif.json |
| List of severities to match. for SARIF file report | `polaris.reports.sarif.severities` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_REPORTS_SARIF_SEVERITIES` | `polaris.reports.sarif.severities` | No | Only issues that match one of the indicated severities will be included in the SARIF file report. (Severities are case-insensitive.)  For example, `["high", "critical"]`  No validations shall be done.  If this is not configured, by default all severities are considered. |
| Indicate which assessment issues type to include in SARIF file report | `polaris.reports.sarif.issue.types` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_SARIF_ISSUE_TYPES` | `polaris.reports.sarif.issue.types` | No | Value of "assessment.types" resource |
| Flag to enable/disable Component-Version grouping for SCA Issues in SARIF report rules section. | `polaris.reports.sarif.groupSCAIssues` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_REPORTS_SARIF_GROUPSCAISSUES` | `polaris.reports.sarif.groupSCAIssues` | No | Set to "true" to enable grouping of SCA issues by component.  **Default:** true |
| The test mode type for this scan. | `polaris.assessment.mode` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_ASSESSMENT_MODE` | `polaris.assessment.mode` | No | **Default**: CI, to scan source code at the CI platform.  **Note**: `polaris.assessment.mode=SOURCE_UPLOAD` is scheduled for deprecation. Please use `polaris.test.sast.location` and/or `polaris.sca.test.location` instead. A deprecation warning message is logged if `polaris.assessment.mode=SOURCE_UPLOAD` is used. |
| Configure location for where source code should be scanned for an SCA assessment type. | `polaris.test.sca.location` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_TEST_SCA_LOCATION` | `polaris.test.sca.location` | No. Required for Source Code Upload for SCA assessment type. | Valid values are `hybrid` or `remote`.    **Default**: `hybrid`, is the default mode. In this mode, Bridge would download the tools to run capture locally and upload the captured artifacts (bdio) to run analysis on the cloud.    Setting this property to a value of `remote` would result in Bridge uploading the source code to the Polaris platform for SCA scanning and analysis, instead of downloading tools and scanning the source code locally or on the CI platform. |
| Configure location for where source code should be captured and built for a SAST assessment type. | `polaris.test.sast.location` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_TEST_SAST_LOCATION` | `polaris.test.sast.location` | No. Required for Source Code Upload for SAST assessment type. | Valid values are `hybrid`, `local` or `remote`.    **Default**: `hybrid`, is the default mode. In this mode, Bridge would download the tools to run capture locally and upload the captured artifacts (idir) to run analysis on the cloud.    Setting this property to a value of `remote` would result in Bridge uploading the source code to the Polaris platform for scanning and analysis, instead of downloading tools and scanning the source code locally or on the CI platform    Setting this property to a value of `local` would result in Bridge downloading the tools to run capture and analysis locally and upload the results to the cloud. Note: When SAST Fix PRs are enabled, valid values are `hybrid` or `remote`. If `local` is specified, SAST Fix PRs will be skipped and a warning will be logged. |
| The project source directory. | `project.directory` | `BRIDGE_PROJECT_DIRECTORY` | `project.directory` | No | String that specifies the project directory to upload. The project.directory should be a valid file path for the file system you are in.  If it is empty, Bridge will use the current working directory (pwd).  Note: - Works for both `CI` and `SOURCE_UPLOAD` |
| The zipped source file path. | `project.source.archive` | `BRIDGE_PROJECT_SOURCE_ARCHIVE` | `project.source.archive` | No | The file must be a zip format file.  If it is not empty, Bridge will not create a zip archive from project directory  If user sets the `project.source.archive` Bridge will upload it to Polaris and run the scan.  If user does not set `project.source.archive` ,Bridge will archive the project directory and upload it to Polaris. |
| Comma-separated list of git ignore pattern strings used to exclude files and directories from the source archive created by Bridge for Polaris source upload scans when `polaris.test.sast.location=remote`. | `project.source.excludes` | `BRIDGE_PROJECT_SOURCE_EXCLUDES` | `project.source.excludes` | No | **Example:** "generated/**,node_modules/**"  **Default:** ""  Logs an info message if Bridge is using the default.  The .bridge and .git directories are automatically excluded from the generated source archive, even when `project.source.excludes` is configured.  The value specified for resource `project.source.excludes` should be a gitignore pattern, not file paths. See gitignore documentation: <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore> |
| Project Symlinks | `project.source.preserveSymlinks` | `BRIDGE_PROJECT_SOURCE_PRESERVESYMLINKS` | `project.source.preserveSymlinks` | No | **Default:**false. Bridge will save the copy of the target file to the zip archive. If the symlink is a directory, Bridge will copy the files in the target directory recursively to the zip archive.  When `project.source.preserveSymlinks`is set as true, Bridge will preserve the links to the zip file.  Note: If `project.source.preserveSymlinks`is set as true and there are symlinks to locations outside of the project (or absolute path links) this will cause issues when uploading to Polaris since the analysis environment won’t have those files or directories needed to satisfy the symlink. |
| SCA Test Type | `polaris.test.sca.type` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_TEST_SCA_TYPE` | `polaris.test.sca.type` | No | Allows you to run a Package Manager scan, a Signature scan, an SCA binary scan or an SCA container scan.    Only Package Manager and Signature scans can run together in the same pipeline; in that case, Bridge creates two tests in Polaris.  When `polaris.test.sca.type` is set to `SCA_BINARY`, configure the binary artifact path using `polaris.artifactToUpload`.  When polaris.test.sca.type is set to `SCA_CONTAINER`, configure the container image .tar artifact using `polaris.artifactToUpload`.  For more detailed information about SCA functionality, see [Documentation for Black Duck SCA Detectors](https://docs.blackduck.com/access?ft:originId=9c0814dc6c47bd8e1b015657cf47a869/a16d3a857a61dddb1b8441d2c754d3bf.topic).  **Default**: `SCA-PACKAGE`  **Accepted values**:  - `SCA-PACKAGE` - `SCA-SIGNATURE` - `SCA-PACKAGE,SCA-SIGNATURE` - `SCA_BINARY` - `SCA_CONTAINER`  Note: Pull Request Comment workflow is ignored when triggered with a Signature scan. GitHub Issues, SARIF report and GitLab report generation are not supported for SCA Container scans. |
| SAST Test Type | `polaris.test.sast.type` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_TEST_SAST_TYPE` | `polaris.test.sast.type` | No | This parameter allows you to run a full SAST scan, or a rapid SAST scan. If this parameter is not set, the default value will be used. Default value: `SAST-FULL`  Acceptable values:  - `SAST-FULL` - `SAST-RAPID`  **Important:** A full SAST scan of the project must be completed before using `SAST-RAPID`. If you attempt to run a rapid scan on a project before you run a full scan, Bridge starts a full SAST scan automatically. |
| SCA artifact path for binary or container scans | `polaris.artifactToUpload` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_ARTIFACTTOUPLOAD` | `polaris.artifactToUpload` | No. Required when `polaris.test.sca.type` is set to `SCA_BINARY` or `SCA_CONTAINER` | Path to the file to upload for SCA scanning. Required when `polaris.test.sca.type` is `SCA_BINARY` (binary or archive file) or `SCA_CONTAINER` (container image .tar, .tgz, .gz or .zip archive).  Supports absolute and relative paths; relative paths are resolved against the current working directory.  Directory paths are not supported. |
| SCA container resource name | `polaris.container.name` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_CONTAINER_NAME` | `polaris.container.name` | No. Required when `polaris.test.sca.type` is set to `SCA_CONTAINER` | Name of the container resource to associate with the scan target. The container name will be listed in the containers section of the project in Polaris web UI and can also be used as a filter. Note: `polaris.branch.name` is not validated for SCA Container scans. |
| Enable/disable waitforscan | `polaris.waitforscan` | `BRIDGE_POLARIS_WAIT_FOR_SCAN` | `polaris.waitforscan` | No | Indicates if the workflow should wait for the analysis to complete or not.  **Default:**`true`  Note: When run with `waitforscan` set to `false` - Bridge would show an INFO message, will exit after queuing the tests on cloud, and not do any post analysis operations (i.e. break build, pr comments / sarif) |

**JSON Input**

Here is a sample `input.json` file that can be used with Polaris.

```
{
    "data": {
        "polaris": {
            "application": {
                "name": "<Application Name>"

## Polaris Secure Tunnel

*Polaris Secure Tunnel* lets you securely connect to internal web applications and APIs for the purpose of running dynamic tests (DAST) using [Polaris fAST Dynamic](https://docs.blackduck.com/access?ft:originId=4411d74355056751ace3917564d29bc0/72b5b3601c618e30303c8fa224dca111.topic). Run Polaris Secure Tunnel to establish a secure TLS connection between Polaris and an internal target in a private network. Run Polaris Secure Tunnel locally, on a virtual machine, or other runner, and leave it running until your DAST testing is complete.

Important: The location from where Polaris Secure Tunnel runs must be able to communicate with both your internal DAST target and Polaris (via port 443).

| Command line argument | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `polaris.serverUrl` | Yes | The Polaris server URL, either `https://polaris.blackduck.com`, `https://poc.polaris.blackduck.com`, `https://ksa.polaris.blackduck.com` or `https://eu.polaris.blackduck.com`. |
| `polaris.application.name` | Yes, if not using `polaris.tunnel.name` | The name of the application that contains a DAST project to scan. The application must already exist inPolaris and have the right entitlements. |
| `polaris.project.name` | Yes, if not using `polaris.tunnel.name` | The name of the DAST project you wish to scan. The project must already exist in Polaris, and the Entry Point URL is in a private network option must be enabled (in the project's settings). |
| `polaris.tunnel.name` | Yes, if not using `polaris.application.name` and `polaris.project.name` | Name of the tunnel to fetch as defined in Polaris in Organizations > Secure Tunnel. When provided, Bridge CLI fetches the tunnel configuration using the tunnel name instead of deriving it from the application/project. Can be used independently without `polaris.application.name` and `polaris.project.name` for the `polaris-secure-tunnel` workflow. Note: In the DAST project settings, if the Entry Point URL is in a private network option is enabled the name of the secure tunnel should be assigned. |

Here is an example command using `polaris.application.name` and `polaris.project.name`:

```
bridge-cli --stage polaris-secure-tunnel polaris.application.name="My Application" polaris.project.name="Internal DAST target" polaris.serverUrl="https://polaris.blackduck.com"
```

Here is an example command that uses `polaris.tunnel.name`:

```
bridge-cli --stage polaris-secure-tunnel polaris.tunnel.name ="My-Secure-Tunnel" polaris.serverUrl="https://polaris.blackduck.com"
```

Note: See Connect to an internal DAST target from Bridge CLI for more information.

## Black Duck® SCA

The base command to run the scan.

```
