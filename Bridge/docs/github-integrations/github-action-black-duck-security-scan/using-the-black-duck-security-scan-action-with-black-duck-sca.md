# Using the Black Duck Security Scan Action with Black Duck SCA

As a GitHub Actions with Black Duck® SCA customer, you can use Bridge CLI to automate SCA scanning in your CI pipeline.

You can use Bridge CLI with Black Duck® SCA in the following ways:

- Adding pull request comments to GitHub
- Exporting a SARIF file
- Uploading Black Duck® SCA issues to GitHub Advanced Security

The Black Duck Security Scan Action supports both self-hosted (e.g., on-prem) and Black Duck hosted Black Duck® SCA Hub instances.

In the default Black Duck® SCA Hub permission model, projects and project versions are created on the fly and as needed. Ensure that permissions needed to create projects and project versions are granted on Black Duck® SCA Hub.

For an overview about using PR Comments, please see the following documentation page: Pull request (PR) comments

Black Duck Security Scan Action requires that you run full “intelligent” Black Duck® SCA scans for SCM push events and “rapid” ephemeral scans for SCM pull request events as shown in the example below.

Note: Detect specific options can be passed through Detect environment variables.

Below is an example of a `workflow.yml` file configured for Black Duck® SCA.

```
name: CI-BlackDuck-SCA-Basic
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master, develop, stage, release]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master, develop, stage, release]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]
    steps:

    - name: Black Duck SCA Scan
      id: black-duck-sca-scan
      uses: blackduck-inc/black-duck-security-scan@v2
      
      ### Configure DETECT environment variables

        ### Uncomment below configuration to add custom logic based on return status
        # - name: cmdLine
        #   id: cmdLine
        #   run: |
        #     EXIT_CODE=${{ steps.black-duck-security-scan.outputs.status }}
        #     echo "Black Duck Security Scan exit status - $EXIT_CODE"
```

**Creating Fix Pull requests**

- `blackduck_fixpr_enabled`: By default, fix pull request creation is disabled (Black Duck Security Scan Action will not create fix pull requests for vulnerable direct dependencies.). To enable this feature, set `blackduck_fixpr_enabled` as `true`.
- `github_token`: You must pass `github_token` parameter with required permissions. The token can be GitHub `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` with required permissions. For more information on GitHub tokens see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication)
- Due to rate limit restriction of GitHub rest API calls, note that GitHub might limit the number of pull requests that are created by Black Duck Security Scan Action.

What follows is a more detailed example of a `workflow.yml` file configured for Black Duck SCA for more advanced users.

## Uploading Black Duck Security Scan Action issues to GitHub Advanced Security

To upload Black Duck Security Scan Action results in GitHub Advanced Security tab, you need to have the following options enabled as shown in the examples above:

1. Create SARIF file (Option: `blackducksca_reports_sarif_create`)
2. Upload SARIF file (Option: `blackducksca_upload_sarif_report`)

GitHub Enterprise (GHE) server users can upload SARIF reports as well. This feature has been verified on Enterprise Server version 3.15. Prior to uploading SARIFs to the GitHub Advanced Security dashboard on your GHE server, ensure that these prerequisites are met:

- **GitHub Advanced Security** must be enabled for the repository.
- **Code scanning** should be activated.
- The **GitHub Actions workflow** must have `security-events: write` permission.

Important: People with admin permissions to a repository, or the security manager role for the repository, can configure code scanning for that repository. People with write permissions to a repository can also configure code scanning, but only by creating a workflow file or manually uploading a SARIF file.

Code scanning is available for all public repositories on [GitHub](http://github.com/). Code scanning is also available for private repositories owned by organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub Enterprise Server. This feature requires a license for GitHub Advanced Security. For more information, see "[About GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security)."
